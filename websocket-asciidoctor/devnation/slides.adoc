SLIDE 1 : Introduction
----

Hi, Thanks for coming, it's a honor for me to be here. So thanks to the DevNation team.
My name is Maxime Gréau. As you can hear, I'm a French guy and I will do my best to be well understood despite my accent.

So I'm here to speak mainly about Java EE 7, WebSocket and Asciidoctor and others technologies.
And I will show you how all those technologies can fit together in order to do a Real-time Collaborative Editor for AsciiDoc

----
SLIDE 2 : Overview

* HERE WE ARE !
* Writing e-mail is easy. We do it all the time. Every day, we respond to dozens of e-mail
and social media messages with Twitter, facebook.... That involves communication through writing. 
That’s right, writing!
* So Writing documentation has to be as easy as writing email !
* So how can we write documentation on an easy way ?

== *AsciiDoc* to the rescue

[NOTE.speaker]
====
----
SLIDE 7 : AsciiDoc
----
* The idea behind lightweight markup languages such as AsciiDoc is "Forget about the layout and styling and just let the thoughts flow"  
* AsciiDoc is being around for a while. It was created twelve years ago and based on Python.

SLIDE 8 : AsciiDoc
----
* So What is AsciiDoc ?
AsciiDoc is two things:

** A mature[1], plain-text format for authoring notes, articles, documentation, 
books, ebooks, web pages, slide decks, blog posts, man pages and more.
** A text processor and toolchain for translating AsciiDoc documents into various formats (called backends), 
including HTML, DocBook, PDF and ePub[2].

AsciiDoc provide a plain text syntax designed for humans--easy to edit, read, version and share in raw form.

== AsciiDoc : *Lightweight markup*

[source, asciidoc]
----
= Document Title2
Doc Writer <doc@asciidoc.org>
v1.0, 2013-01-01: Initial version

http://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc] is a lightweight markup language.

This is the optional preamble (an untitled section body), useful for
writing simple sectionless documents consisting only of a preamble.

NOTE: The abstract, preface, appendix, bibliography, glossary and
index section titles are significant (_specialsections_).

== First section

Document sections start at *level 1* and can nest four levels deep.

* Item 1
* Item 2
----

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
----
SLIDE 9 : example
----
* so here is an example.
* this is just plain text
* you see a couple of annotations
* the first thing is just the title    
* then we have a paragraph 
* then we have an other section 
* AsciiDoc gets us back to what’s important: writing. 

You can drop those angle brackets, but you don’t have to drop the semantics. 
And it’s a syntax that a human can actually edit, efficiently.

"Use _AsciiDoc_ for document markup. It's actually _readable_ by humans, _easier to parse_ way more flexible than XML."
-- Linus Torvald

[NOTE.speaker]
====
----
SLIDE 10 : Linus Torvald
----
* Why do you need to use AsciiDoc for documentation... because Linus Torvald said it.
More seriously, AsciiDoc works because:

** It’s readable
** It’s concise
** It’s comprehensive
** It’s extensible
** It produces beautiful output (HTML, DocBook, PDF, ePub and more)

* Regarding to the other office tools, AsciiDoc gives you the possibility to
follow almost the same workflow that you have when writing code :
** refactor the documentation
** do a simple diff on documentation
So It looks like code, it hacks like code, it can be check on the source code revising control just like code

[[slide11]]
[.intro.topic]
== What's *Asciidoctor* ?

[NOTE.speaker]
====
----
SLIDE 11 : Asciidoctor
----
* Remember that I said that AsciiDoc is not really that new. 
It's Python based but there is a bright new tools out there since 2013, which is ruby based.
There are ways to run this things inside the JVM and this is Asciidoctor.

[NOTE.speaker]
====
----
SLIDE 12 : Asciidoctor
----
* Asciidoctor is a modern open-source implementation of AsciiDoc, written in Ruby mainly by Dan Allen and the community
* The idea is : 
** we have a asciidoc document
** we have an asciidoc processor
** we put the document to the processor
** and VOILA => it comes to HTML
====


[[slide13]]
[.topic]
== Output *formats* (i.e., backends)

[.incremental]
* HTML 5
* DocBook 4.5 & 5.0
* PDF [detail]#fop, dblatex#
* eBook [detail]#ePub 2, mobi#
* slides [detail]#deck.js, dzslides, reveal.js#
* man pages
* *custom*

[NOTE.speaker]
====
----
SLIDE 13 : Output
----
* So what can Asciidoctor make ?
* Asciidoctor can do HTML5, DocBook, PDF, ePub, mobi
* Asciidoctor can do slides like this deck, can do man pages
* and most important "anything you want"
** you have the ability to plug in your own backend so the HTML that you get, is not the HTML that you have to have 
**  Asciidocotor built a document Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), not to different to our source code (when we have classes and methods) 
so you have the ability to manipulate the document and you can create whatever you want
====

[[slide14]]
[.topic]
== How do I *use* Asciidoctor ?

[.incremental]
* Ruby [detail]#asciidoctor asciidoctor-pdf#
* Java [detail]#asciidoctorJ, asciidoctor-maven-plugin#
* Groovy [detail]#asciidoctor-gradle-plugin#
* Javascript [detail]#asciidoctor.js, Chrome/Firefox extension#

[NOTE.speaker]
====
----
SLIDE 14 : Polyglot
----
* The main project is asciidoctor, implemented in Ruby. asciidoctor-pdf is a native PDF renderer for AsciiDoc built with asciidoctor and prawn. AsciiDoc direct to PDF.
* So, ok it's Ruby,  but Ruby runs on the JVM thanks to JRuby !!
** There is an other project called AsciidoctorJ which is a wrapper on top of plain asciidoctor using JRUby
so you do not need Ruby to run Asciidoctor, you just need Java
** And from there we can construct any other tools based on the JVM that consumes asciidoctorJ and in this case we have a maven plugin and a gradle plugin
* You can also run Asciidoctor throught Javascript, Ruby has a transpiler call Opal. Opal transforms Ruby code into Javascript code so you can run Asciidoctor on the browser or anywhere that Javascript can be run.
** There are also a Chrome extension and a Firefox addon
* So we have a POLYGLOT environment here

[[slide15]]
[.topic]
== *Who* is using Asciidoctor ?

[.pull-right]
* Frameworks [detail]#Spring, Infinispan#
* JSR [detail]#CDI Specifications#
* Publishers [detail]#O'Reilly#
* Repositories [detail]#Github, Bintray#
* and more...

[NOTE.speaker]
====
----
SLIDE 15 : Who use it
----
* So Asciidoctor is a really new project but it's already much used, in fact we have
** some frameworks which generates their technical documentation with Asciidoctor like Spring, Infinispan and others
** There are already 1 JSR which used Asciidoctor : CDI specification
** there are also some publisher like O'Reilly (enterprise Web Book)
** some repositories like Github, in fact you can write your doc file like README with AsciiDoc and you will see the rendered HTML

SLIDE 16 : DEMO asciidoctor.js
----
* Local : prepare a server
* Online : http://tinyurl.com/adeditor
* DEMO :
. Present the ad-editor
.. on the left side, you have the AsciiDoc editor based on angular-ui-ace-editor
.. on the top of the screen, you have the navbar which tells you if you are working online or offline
.. in this case we are on offline mode since we just want to use Asciidoctor through asciidoctor.js, so we don't need the server to be started.
.. on the right side, we have the HTML5 rendered view, so here is the HTML5 generated by Opal.js and asciidoctor.js
. so let's goto the demo
.. do a drag and drop (HTML5) with the demo1.adoc
.. render it with Alt+R
.. change mode to "on change"
.. add a title before the first section
.. copy/paste source code to show higlight
.. talk about HTML5 features like storage with indexedDB, drag and drop

CONCLUDE:
* Ok that was the demo in order to show how Asciidoctor works with asciidoctor.js and some HTML5 features like drag and drop and storage with IndexedDB.

like render only a selected part of it. Plus Asciidoctor can render slides, Plus WebSocket which provide a full-duplex bi-directional protocol...
