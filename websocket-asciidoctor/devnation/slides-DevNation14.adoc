. Text : Introduce myself

Hi, Thanks for coming, it's a honor for me to be here. So thanks to the DevNation team
My name is Maxime Gréau and I work for the French Ministry for Economy and Finances in France.
As you can hear, I'm a French guy. 
and I will do my best to be well understood despite my accent.

. Text : Overview

So I'm here to speak mainly about WebSocket Java EE 7 and Asciidoctor but also about HTML5, Angular and CDI
And I will show you how all this technology can fit together in order to do a Real-time Collaborative Editor for AsciiDoc

Doc Writer <doc@asciidoc.org>
v1.0, 2013-01-01: Initial version

http://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc] is a lightweight markup language.

This is the optional preamble (an untitled section body), useful for
writing simple sectionless documents consisting only of a preamble.

NOTE: The abstract, preface, appendix, bibliography, glossary and
index section titles are significant (_specialsections_).

== First section

Document sections start at *level 1* and can nest four levels deep.

* Item 1
* Item 2
