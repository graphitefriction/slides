Asciidoctor - Dan Allen
-----------------------

Welcome everyone.
Ready to discovering the zen of writing asciidoc
....
About presentation:
-----
Writing email is easy. We do it all the time. Writing documentation, on the other hand is hard.
We practically have to force ourselves to do it. Of the two, documentation has a much greater impact on our success and the success of our projects.

Why, then, do we make it more difficult by buring the content in XML or struggling with finicky WSYWIG editors ?

What if you could write documentation just as you write email? Forget about the layout and styling and just let the thoughts flow ? That's the idea behind lightweight markup languages such as AsciiDoc. they provide a plain text syntax designed for humas-easy to edit, read, version and share in raw form.

AsciiDoc goes further by satisfying even the most advanced technical semantics and publishing requirements. AsciiDoc is a capable shorthand alternative to DocBook and can produce beautiful HTML5, ePub and PDF output-even slides.
